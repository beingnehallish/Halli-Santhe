# 🌾 Halli-Santhe Digital (Retail)

## 📌 Project Overview

Halli-Santhe Digital is a **Hyper-Local Marketplace Android Application** developed using **Jetpack Compose + Room Database**.  
The application helps village artisans showcase and sell their handmade products digitally while allowing customers to browse and contact sellers easily.

This project promotes the concept of **"Vocal for Local"** by connecting local artisans directly with buyers through a modern mobile platform.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Local artisans often have limited reach because they sell products only in physical weekly markets.  
Customers are usually unaware of available products unless they travel to those markets.

Halli-Santhe Digital solves this problem by creating a digital catalog marketplace where artisan products can be discovered easily.

# 💬 Smart Chat Simulation

The project contains a simulated chat system between customer and seller.

### Example Auto Responses

| Customer Message | Vendor Auto Reply |
|---|---|
| "stock" | "Yes, we are currently in stock 😊" |
| "bulk" | "I need to check bulk availability." |
| "payment" | "The QR code will be sent via SMS soon." |
| "delivery" | "Delivery usually takes 3-5 business days 🚚" |

This gives the application an AI-like interactive experience without requiring a real backend chat server.
